Hackathon Solution Approach
By Gaurav Thakur
Process Steps
• Data Acquisition
• Data Preprocessing
• Model Selection
• Model Training
• Model evaluation
• Predictions
Data Acquisition
• Platform - Google colab
• Import required libraries.
• Mount the drive and import the training and test datasets
Data Preprocessing
• No missing values.
• Drop columns which are unique and can’t get used as independent variables
(row_id,video_id)
• Encoding-
• Label encoding on gender and profession columns for Random Forest Regression
Model Selection
Models implemented:
• Linear regression and polynomial regression
• One hot encoding on gender and profession.
• Dropped user_id and category_id
• Decision Tree
• Label encoding on gender and profession
• Max_depth = 200
• Random Forest
• Label encoding on gender and profession
• N_estimators = 1000
• GBM
• Label encoding on gender and profession
• N_estimators = 1000
• max_depth=10,min_samples_split= 4,learning_rate= 0.05,random_state=0
Chosen model is random forest.
# Though r2 score of GBM was more than Random forest but random forest showed better
result with test data on submission
Model Training
• Model used- Random Forest Regressor
• N_estimators = 1000, random state = 0
• Train the model on training dataset and use the model for predicting test data results.
Model Evaluation metrics
r2_score_splittedtest= 0.45308118325154545
Result
• Implement the model on test data to get the results.
• Convert the result into the required format of csv file having two columns - row_id and
engagement_score.
• Upload the predictions on drive
